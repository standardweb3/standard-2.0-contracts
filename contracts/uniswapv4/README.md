### **Limit/Market orders with Uniswap V4 Hooks ðŸ¦„**

*"if ETH drops below $1500, market sell my bags"*

*"Only sell ETH when the price goes up to $1600"*

*"Allow slippage of 0.5% on market price, store amount which exceeds slippage threshold to limit order"*

Integrated directly into the Uniswap V4 pools, limit/market orders are posted onchain and executed via the `afterSwap()` hook. No external bots or actors are required to guarantee execution.

---

## Use Cases

* <ins>Spot traders</ins>: protect slippage or theft by MEVs

* <ins>Leverage traders</ins>: use stop loss proceeds to repay loans. Please see [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for usage

* <ins>Lending Protocols (advanced)</ins>: use limit/market/stop orders to *liquidate collateral* without significant price actions. Instead of liquidation bots and external participants, stop losses offer guaranteed execution
    * Note: additional safety is required to ensure that large market orders do not result in bad debt.

## Features

* Guaranteed execution -- if the pool crosses the user-specified tick, the posted capital is guaranteed to market-sell

* Asynchronous claims -- opening a stop loss order gives data space for an order in Standard orderbook. Upon successful order execution, the trading token is sent to the trader or liquidator's wallet.

# Notice

this project was inspired by [v4-stoploss](https://github.com/saucepoint/v4-stoploss/tree/main), and the project was inspired by [uniswap v4 example](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/blob/main/contracts/hooks/examples/LimitOrder.sol).

The difference of this project is to make the hook more scalable by implementing orderbook storage and matching engine with greedy algorithm, replacing key-value storage order without sorting or handling multiple orders. The orderbook exchange contracts have license of [BUSL](https://github.com/standardweb3/standard-2.0-contracts/blob/main/contracts/safex/LICENSE).
