## Pre-requisites

Before delving into the Standard monorepo contracts, ensure your environment is prepared and know how to use these tools.

**Required Tools**:

- [**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation): A core development tool for the contracts.
- [**Forge**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/): An essential package for building and deploying.
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install): A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool used to install and manage the project's dependencies.

To set up these tools, visit their respective [official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) for [installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

## Usage

Navigate your way through the Standard monorepo contracts with the following procedures:

## Security

When working with contracts, especially in a live environment, security is paramount. Follow best practices and always stay updated with the latest security advisories.

**Guidelines:**

- Always test new code in a sandboxed environment before deploying.
- Regularly audit your contracts for vulnerabilities.
- Keep private keys and sensitive information secure.

If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them responsibly to our team via [official communication channels](mailto:contact@standardweb3.com).
